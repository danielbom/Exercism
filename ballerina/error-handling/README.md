# Service Error Handling

Welcome to Service Error Handling on Exercism's Ballerina Track.
If you need help running the tests or submitting your code, check out `HELP.md`.

## Instructions

Implement various kinds of error handling and resource management.

An important point of programming is how to handle errors and close resources even if errors occur.

This exercise requires you to handle various errors.
Because error handling is rather programming language specific you'll have to refer to the tests for your track to see what's exactly required.
